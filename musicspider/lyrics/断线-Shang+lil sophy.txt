I'm feeling really bad right now and um
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it so
I guess it's goodbye
Baby  I know I've done you wrong
I can hear it in your songs
I can see it on your face
Won't be long for I'm replace
I'll miss the times we had
And I'll miss the laughs we shared
I'll miss staying up till midnight
Hey um
And the times when everything felt right

我关于你的记忆
消失了一件又一件
午夜的未接来电
我拨打了一遍又一遍
我想要听我的脉搏心跳
却又断了线
睡梦中你的身影
复习了一面又一面
漫长的夜 开始分裂 昏暗的灯火也慢慢熄灭
不想了解 我的一切
酒后的真心话全都不屑
我不想再去怀念
走心的话我都留在心里面
我学着把冷漠
挂在嘴边白天到黑夜
Baby I don't even need you
Baby I don't even miss you
Baby I don't know if it is true
Baby I just want to heal myself
Baby take it all away

I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna feel this way
I can see the stars in your eyes
I was trying to feel OK
I just wanna heal my own brain

Baby I know I've done you wrong
I can hear it in your songs
I can see it on your face
Won't be long for I'm replaced
I'll miss the times we had
And I'll miss the laughs we shared
I'll miss staying up till midnight
And the times when everything felt right

我要把所有关于
我们的记忆删个遍
像张白纸再也不会
为谁触了电
卑微的生活
还是毁灭全都随我便
我落魄的样子
谁也不能忍心看的见
配不配 对不对
你怎样我都无所谓
睡不睡 累不累
从来都不害怕浪费
你可千万不要嫌弃
我身上掩盖的烟酒味
难过的时候谁也不会
独自孤单掉着泪 Baby I don't even need you
Baby I don't even miss you
Baby I don't know if it is true
Baby I just want to heal myself
Baby take it all away

I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna feel this way
I can see the stars in your eyes
I was trying to feel OK
I just wanna heal my own brain
I just wanna heal my own brain
I just wanna heal my own brain
I just wanna heal my own brain
I just wanna heal my own brain
