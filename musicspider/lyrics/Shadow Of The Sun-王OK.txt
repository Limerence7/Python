And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun.
Seizing time where no one has been before
Close the curtains what are you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets till I'm in the ground.

Changing colors makes you waste away,
Just paint your eyes with a vivid mind.
Now you see what's behind the lights,
And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun.
Finding treasures that‘s been on demise,
Building mountains in disguise,
And I'll be keeping secrets till I'm in the ground.

I’m in the shadow of the shadow of the sun,
Where I belong there's something coming on.
I’m in the shadow of the shadow of the sun,
oh and I need you.

I’m in the shadow of the shadow of the sun,
where I belong, there's something coming on.
No more waiting, times are changing,
And there's something coming on.
And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun.
