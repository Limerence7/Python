 Hate to give the satisfaction askin' how you're doin' now
 How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
 Just what you wanted, look at you, cool guy, you got it
 I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
 Six months of torture that you sold as some forbidden paradise
 I loved you truly, I gotta laugh at the stupidity

 'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
 But you make the worst one look fine
 I should've known it was strange
 You only come out at night
 I used to think I was smart
 But you made me look so naïve
 The way you sold me for parts
 As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
 Bloodsucker, fame ****er
 Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

 Every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
 You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too
 You're so convincin'
 How do you lie without flinchin'? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
 Oh, what a mesmerizin', paralyzin', ****ed up little thrill
 Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
 Went for me and not her
 'Cause girls your age know better

 'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
 But you make the worst one look fine
 I should've known it was strange
 You only come out at night
 I used to think I was smart
 But you made me look so naïve
 The way you sold me for parts
 As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
 Bloodsucker, fame ****er
 Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

 Ah
 You said it was true love
 But wouldn't that be hard?
 You can't love anyone
 'Cause that would mean you had a heart
 I tried you help you out, now I know that I can't
 'Cause how you think’s the kind of thing
 I'll never understand

 I've made some real big mistakes
 But you make the worst one look fine
 I should've known it was strange
 You only come out at night
 I used to think I was smart
 But you made me look so naïve
 The way you sold me for parts
 As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
 Bloodsucker, fame ****er
 Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
