
I always feel the same way
Driving home empty
I'm on autopilot
Come rescue me
I can't even tell the days apart
I'm on repeat
Come rescue me
It's time for me to find some peace

I might go insane
If I can't erase
My own thoughts
Of strangling me
I might go insane
I think I'm in flames
My brain got the best of me

I might go insane
If I can't erase
My own thoughts
Of strangling me
I might go insane
I think I'm in flames
My brain got the best of me

Very extra
