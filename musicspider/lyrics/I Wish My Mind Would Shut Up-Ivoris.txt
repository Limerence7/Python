I’ve been doing what they tell me
I’ve been tryna meditate
But it didn’t really help me
And I haven’t got the patience
Even took up yoga
And journaling my thoughts
You should see my diary
Cause it goes on for pages

But when the lights go down and i’m all alone
All the fears come out dressed as the unknown
It’s a messy maze I can’t navigate
It’s a heavy flood and someone broke the gates

I wish it was quiet
I overthink too much
Yeah I’m Rapunzel stuck inside my head
No peace in my mind
It goes on and on
Wish I could turn it off and it would shut up

I wish my mind would shut up
(I don’t wanna stay in my mind
overthinking every night)
I wish my mind would shut up
(I don’t wanna stay in my mind)

I wish it was quiet
I overthink too much
Yeah I’m Rapunzel stuck inside my head
No peace in my mind
It goes on and on
Wish I could turn it off and it would shut up

(I don’t wanna stay in my mind)
I wish my mind would shut up
(I don’t wanna stay in my mind)
I wish my mind would shut up
(I don’t wanna stay in my mind)
I wish my mind would shut up, shut up
