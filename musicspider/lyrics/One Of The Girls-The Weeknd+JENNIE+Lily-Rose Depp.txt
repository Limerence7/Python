 JENNIE：
 Lock me up and throw away the key
 He knows how to get the best out of me
 I'm no force for the world to see
 Trade my whole life just to be

 The Weeknd：
 Tell nobody I control you
 I broke you just to own you
 They can't tell that I love you
 'Cause you're loyal, baby
 I love when you're submissive
 You love it when I break skin
 You feel pain without flinchin'
 So say it

 Lily-Rose Depp：
 Give me tough love
 Leave me with nothin' when I come down
 My kind of love
 Push me and choke me 'til I pass out

 We don't gotta be in love, no
 I don't gotta be the one, no
 I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
 We don't gotta be in love, no
 I don't gotta be the one, no
 I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh-oh-oh

 Push me down, hold me down
 Spit in my mouth while you turn me out
 I wanna take your light inside
 Tear me down, snuff me out
 Hands on my neck while you push it up
 And I'm screamin' out

 The Weeknd：
 Give me tough love
 Leave me with nothin' when I come down
 My kind of love
 Force me and choke me 'til I pass out

 Lily-Rose Depp/The Weeknd：
 We don't gotta be in love, no
 I don't gotta be the one, no
 I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)
 We don't gotta be in love, no
 I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)
 I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh-oh-oh

 JENNIE：
 Lock me up and throw away the key
 He knows how to get the best out of me
 I'm no force for the world to see
 Trade my whole life just to be
 Top of the world but I'm still not free
 This is a secret that I keep
 Until it's gone, I can never find peace
 Waste my whole life just to be

 Lily-Rose Depp/The Weeknd：
 We don't gotta be in love, no
 I don't gotta be the one, no
 I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)
 We don't gotta be in love, no
 I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)
 I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Oh), oh-oh-oh
