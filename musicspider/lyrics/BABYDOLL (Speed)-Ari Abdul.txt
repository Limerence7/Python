Call me Babydoll
Darling, I'm fallin'
****ed up over you
Bite me, bruise me
Leave me like you do
Darling, I'm callin'
Lay me in my tomb
(In my tomb)
Call me Babydoll
Come break down these walls
Don't leave me alone
Call me Babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a home
Oh, father, forgive me
For all my sins
When I meet your eyes
The devil, he wins
Blinded by your lies
But I play pretend
(Play pretend)
Call me Babydoll
Come break down these walls
Don't leave me alone
Call me Babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a home
Wrapped around your finger
Wish your tongue would linger
I need your warmth
Just to stay high
Now, you're holding me down
I scream but make no sound
Nothing to hold
My hands are tied
Call me Babydoll
Come break down these walls
Don't leave me alone
Call me Babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a home
