I saw the wild flowers dying as we froze in the winter
Lost my clothes in the water, feel the sand between my toes
All these days we kept trying put our hands on the lions
Never thought we'd stop flying, just to walk this on our own
Oh we're growing old now
Will it ever be the same

Since we slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down (slowed down)
Slowed down (slowed down)
We slowed down (slowed down)
Slowed down (down, down)
We slowed down

We slowed down

We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed, slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed, slowed down

And now we're too deep in the water, I can't see you anymore (see you anymore...)
We slowed down, it's too late to recover
I just can't see you anymore

I can't do this anymore, more
You can knock but I shut the door, door
I don't want this to be a chore

We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
Down, down, down, down
We slowed down

We slowed down

We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed, slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed down
We slowed, slowed down
