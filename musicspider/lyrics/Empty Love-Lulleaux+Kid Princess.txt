All my friends are faded
One of them's half naked
That’s when I really start to hate it
Can't make it 'til three
Then a guy starts asking
To get my number on a napkin
Thinking something’s gonna happen
I'm laughing, boy please
That's why I - I - I
Yeah I always end up outside
Feeling like I'm wasting my time my time
Oh oh
I - I - I - I can't do it anymore yeah I've tried
Looking for what I thought I'd find
Don't want no empty love
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Like Oh
Oh-oh
I’m just walking around in a baseball T don’t want no empty love
Same girls as last night
Yeah they getting in a girl fight
Boys think it's so tight, yeah right
Let’s leave
I don't know what they're chill with
All the drinks keep spilling
And I can still feel them all over me
That's why I - I - I
Yeah I always end up outside
Feeling like I’m wasting my time my time oh oh
I - I - I - I can't do it anymore yeah I've tried
Looking for what I thought I'd find, I'd find
All the girls in the club like omg
All the boys in the club like who is she
All we want here is love but it's so empty
Like oh
All the girls in the club like buy me a drink
All the boys in the club they're starting to stink
I'm just walking around in a baseball T
Don't want no empty love
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Like oh
Oh-oh
I'm just walking around in a baseball T
Don't want no empty love (x3)
