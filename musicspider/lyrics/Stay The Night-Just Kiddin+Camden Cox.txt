I like your face
Oh baby, why don't you come around?
It's getting rainy
Maybe we could sleep on the couch
Let's sign something that can fulfil your appetite
Stay the night
Then in the morning we can listen to pillow talk
When we get lazy I'll take you to the carnival
Just don't go home, oh baby, I'll be your alibi
Stay the night

Just stay the ni-i-ight
Just stay the ni-i-ight
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Stay the night)
