(The Kid LAROI)
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can’t find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

(The Kid LAROI)
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I’ll be ****ed up, if you can't be right here

(The Kid LAROI)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah)
Oh, I'll be ****ed up, if you can't be right here

(Justin Bieber)
When I’m away from you I miss your touch (Ooh)
You’re the reason I believe in love (Ooh)
It's been difficult for me to trust (Ooh)
And I’m afraid that I'ma **** it up (Ooh)
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain’t never left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay
