 Summer too hot

 I blew it all on her, I get it right back
 She put it all on me, I couldn't pipe that
 She love when I pull on it when it's tied back
 You know it's hard to get up out it, I get sidetracked
 Shake something, left, right, control it
 You know who to call if you're horny (Yeah)
 Ride on it, greenlight me (Greenlight, greenlight)

 How'd you tell your friends that you really don't dance? (Don't dance)
 But I know that you can
 ****in' up your plans, we about to get nasty
 Better hold up them glasses

 Summer too hot not to **** it up
 Is the mood right? Is it wet enough?
 I gotta move right, guess I levelеd up
 Let me wet it up just a fеw times
 Summer too hot, had to double up
 Shawty too fire with the bubble butt
 We should move, slide on the regular
 Summer too hot, it's irregular

 Shawty she discreet
 She don't want her business in the street
 Be my little secret
 Baby, be my little freak
 Oh, we can on a weekend
 Do somethin' different, got my attention
 Eight figures, ****in' with a rich nigga
 Big picture, more than just a night with you
 Don't switch up, girl, when the lights hit ya
 Them diamonds gon' dance (Oh, yeah)

 How'd you tell your friends that you really don't dance? (Really don't dance)
 But I know that you can (I know you can)
 ****in' up your plans, we about to get nasty
 Better hold up them glasses (Oh, girl, baby)

 Summer too hot not to **** it up (Huh)
 Is the mood right? (Ayy) Is it wet enough? (Woo)
 I gotta move right, guess I leveled up (Baby)
 Let me wet it up just a few times (Too)
 Summer too hot, had to double up (Too)
 Shawty too fire with the bubble butt (Girl, we should move)
 We should move, slide on the regular (Yeah)
 Summer too hot (Oh-oh-oh), it's irregular

 Ooh
 I wanna get this rocket off the ground, babe
 Ooh
 Oh, you so beautiful, it's hard to behave
 Ooh
 I can't start this fire without your flame
 Ooh
 And I know you feel the same
 Come on, take that shit off

 Summer too hot not to **** it up (Oh)
 Is the mood right? Is it wet enough? (Ooh)
 I gotta move right, guess I leveled up (Oh-oh, ooh)
 Let me wet it up (Ooh) just a few times (Oh-oh, ooh)
 Summer too hot, had to double up (Ay-ay)
 Shawty too fire with the bubble butt (Girl, we should)
 We should move, slide on the regular
 Summer too hot, it's irregular (Summer, summer way too hot)

 Baby, baby, baby, yeah
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Summer too hot, oh-oh
 Baby, baby, baby, yeah
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Summer too hot
