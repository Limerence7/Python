I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs at the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs at the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
Faded

Sober when I'm faded
Permanent vacation
Don't care if I'm jaded
Done with all this faking

I don't wanna have to try, no
I could walk a perfect line, no
I don't want no alibi, no
Don't lose any sleep at night, no

I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs at the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs at the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
Faded

Drinking from the bottle but it's just Pellegrino
Getting ****ed up got real boring, so it's â€˜Grino for placebo

I don't wanna have to try, no
I could walk a perfect line, no
I don't want no alibi, no
Don't lose any sleep at night, no

I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs at the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs at the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
Faded

I don't wanna be normal no more
Faded
I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna be normal no more
Faded

I don't wanna be normal no more
