Knowing that I was going to get better
And looking forward to a time that I would feel good again
Helped me to keep moving forward
And sometimes I had to be brave
And it wasn't always easy
Sometimes I faltered
I had bad days
But I realized that being brave isn't supposed to be easy
As for me
I feel it's the key way to keep moving forward
